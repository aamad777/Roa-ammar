  "why sky is blue?": "Hi Jana! That's a wonderful question! You know how when you're playing with your blue crayon, it looks blue because it's reflecting blue light? The sky is like that too! The sunlight that reaches Earth is made up of all the colors of the rainbow. When this light passes through the Earth's atmosphere, the blue light is scattered in all directions more than any other color because it travels in shorter, smaller waves. So, when we look up at the sky, we see it as blue! Isn't that cool? It's like Earth is using a blue crayon to color the sky for us."
